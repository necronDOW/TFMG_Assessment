Version: Unity 5.5.3f1.

Shader Issue Solution:
The terrain shader doesn't compile correctly when debugging for the first time, showing a white terrain with faint textures.  To fix this, please stop and restart the simulation causing the shader to compile correctly and display colour information.

Alot of time was spent trying to fix this issue to no avail, think it may be version related!

Terrain Generation:
Based off of the "Procedural Landmass Generation" series presented by Sebastian Lague (Available from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbpMiKiSKm8&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0eBW2EiBtl_sxmDtSgZBxB3).  Adapted significantly to include resource data and other metrics for city and forest generation.
